		bio = "**Stay with us** to relax and to explore Nelson, New Zealand. Base yourself here for your tramping adventures, to taste local food and wine or to take a break from your break. If you're a Digital Nomad you will enjoy your own desk, lots of storage space to unpack, ultra fast WiFi, low monthly rates and full access to the kitchen and BBQ. We have travelled New Zealand extensively and will happily give you ideas on what to do. We're both very engaged in the local Startup community, so if you're keen, please tag along. If we find the time we go tramping in one of our three close-by National Parks, go kayak fishing or enjoy a day at the beach."
